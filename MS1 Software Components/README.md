# Milestone One Software Components

This folder is an Arduino Sketchbook for controlling the individual motors and sensors for this project, as part of Milestone 1.
Most of this software is based off of examples provided by the libraries necessary to run the related component.

MS1 Software Components
- libraries: Arduino libraries for interacting with motors/sensors
- I2CDebugger: Script to detect i2c devices on the arduino and on an i2c mux
- LightDependentResistor: Code to communicate with four LDRs and read light intensity values
- LinearActuator: Code to control the linear actuator
- MagAccelSensor: Code to read data from the mag and acceleration sensors
- PowerMonitor: Code to read voltage and current 
- StepperMotor: Code to run the stepper motor
- TemperatureHumiditySensor: Code to read temperature and humidity
